				<strong>Smack That By Akon</strong>
				<pre>
				Shady
				Convict
				Upfront
				Akon
				Slim Shady
				
				I see the one, because she be that lady!
				
				Oh, I feel you creeping
				I can see it from my shadow
				Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
				Maybe go to my place and just kick it like tae-bo
				And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
				
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that, oh-oh!
				
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that, oh-oh!
				
				Upfront style ready to attack now
				Pull in the parking lot slow, with the lock down
				Convicts got the whole thing packed now
				Step in the club now, and wardrobe intact now!
				I feel it down and cracked now (oh)
				I see it dull and backed now
				I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
				Money no problem, pocket full of that now
				
				Oh, I feel you creeping
				I can see it from my shadow
				Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
				Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboo
				And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
				
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that, oh-oh!
				
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that all on the floor
				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that, oh-oh!
				
				Oh, looks like another club banger
				They better hang on when they throw this thang on
				Get a lil' drink on
				They goin' flip for this Akon shit
				You can bank on it!
				Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
				The way she climbs up and down them poles
				Looking like one of them puttie-cat dolls
				Trying to hold my woody back through my drawers
				Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
				Creeps up behind me, shes like, "you're"
				I'm like, ya, I know, lets cut to the chase
				No time to waste, back to my place
				Plus, from the club to the crib's like a mile away
				Or more like a palace shall I say
				And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
				In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing
				Akon!
				
				Oh, I feel you creeping
				I can see it from my shadow
				Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
				Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboo
				And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

				Smack that, give me some more
				Smack that till you get sore
				Smack that, oh-oh!
				
				Eminem is rollin', D and 'em rollin'
				And all marvelous them rolling
				Women just holding big booty rollin'
				Soon I'll be on Eminem throwin' "D!"
				Hittin' on less than "three!"
				Block wheel style like "whee!"
				Girl, I can tell you want me because lately
				
				Oh, I feel you creeping
				I can see it from my shadow
				Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?

				<strong>Welcome to my life By Chris Brown</strong>
				<pre>
				Every dream in my head
				It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
				And when I get to the edge
				I turn around and put that dream behind me
				And it never feels the way I want
				But I keep on trying
				I just keep on trying
				Have you been there?
				Have you seen it all?
				Have you done this once before?
				Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
				Now you're lying on the floor
				And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
				And this is your life
				Your life, your life
				Ow! Welcome to my
				Hello, this is my life in your TV
				I overdose in that night life, them bright lights and bikinis
				I keep my hand on that gold bottle, I'm tryna find me that genie
				They say money doesn't buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in that
				Lamborghini
				Damn, I don't know who I am
				I just know who I wanna be
				No looking back, everything is in front of me
				I never act like they putting a gun to me
				I ain't stuck up, same motherfucker that I've always been
				You must've got me fucked up, 
				because I ain't tryna get that all white Benz
				Never that though
				Been on my job, saying I'm different now
				Say I don't listen now
				I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitching 'bout
				I'm on a mission, feel like I'm missing now
				Bitch you ain't in my position now
				You never walked a mile in my shoes
				I'm feeling so distant now
				Have you been there?
				Have you seen it all?
				Have you done this once before?
				Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
				Now you're lying on the floor
				And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
				And this is your life
				Your life, your life
				Welcome to my life
				I've been thinking too much, I wonder if I did that right
				I've been drinking too much, I don't know what I did last night
				Tried talk to myself like, you don't really wanna live that life
				I wanted it all to myself like, you don't wanna give that life, away
				But I gotta leave, I can't stay
				Part of me say "Keep going", that other hand say "Quit playing"
				Gotta keep praying (praying)
				Even when I got it all , all these broads and alcohol
				Living on the edge, I'm bound to fall (fall)
				But I stay moving, stay climbing (climbing)
				Putting in work, I stay grinding (grinding)
				Looking for the answer, can't find it (can't find it)
				That's the truth, I can't hide it (hide it)
				Now or never forever, that's how I'm living my life
				It's hard to plan for tomorrow, when you just live for the night
				Every dream in my head
				It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
				And when I get to the edge
				I turn around and put that dream behind me
				And it never feels the way I want
				But I keep on trying
				I just keep on trying
				Have you been there?
				Have you seen it all?
				Have you done this once before?
				Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
				Now you're lying on the floor
				And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
				And this is your life
				Your life, your life</pre>

				<strong>Lovers on the Sun By David Guetta</strong>
				<pre>
				Let's light it up
				Let's light it up
				Until our hearts catch fire
				Then show the world a burning light
				That never shined so bright
				We'll find a way
				We'll find a way
				To keep the cold night
				From breaking in over the walls onto the wild side
				The hunger satisfied
				We're burning up
				We might as well be lovers on the sun
				We might as well be lovers on the sun
				We might as well be lovers on the sun
				We'll never know
				We'll never know
				What stands behind the door
				But I got a feeling and it's a feeling that's worth dying for
				Just close your eyes and hold your breath because it feels right
				We'll keep it moving until we make it to the other side
				And let's enjoy the ride
				We're burning up
				We might as well be lovers on the sun
				We might as well be lovers on the sun
				We might as well be lovers on the sun
				Let's light it up
				Let's light it up
				Until our hearts catch fire
				Then show the world a burning light
				That never shined so bright</pre>

				<strong>Baby By Justin Beiber</strong>
				<pre>
				Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
				You know you love me, I know you care
				Just shout whenever and I'll be there
				You are my love, you are my heart
				And we will never, ever, ever be apart
				Are we an item? Girl quit playin'
				We're just friends, what are you sayin'
				Said there's another, look right in my eyes
				My first love, broke my heart for the first time
				And I was like baby, baby, baby oh
				Like baby, baby, baby no
				Like baby, baby, baby oh
				I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
				Baby, baby, baby oh
				Like baby, baby, baby no
				Like baby, baby, baby ooh
				I thought you'd always be mine
				Oh for you, I would have done whatever
				And I just can't believe we ain't together
				And I wanna play it cool
				But I'm losin' you
				I'll buy you anything
				I'll buy you any ring
				And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
				And just shake me, 'til you wake me from this bad dream
				I'm goin' down, down, down, down
				And I can't just believe my first love won't be around
				And I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
				Like baby, baby, baby no
				Like baby, baby, baby oh
				I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
				Baby, baby, baby oh
				Like baby, baby, baby no
				Like baby, baby, baby ooh
				I thought you'd always be mine
				Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
				There was nobody that compared to my baby
				And nobody came between us no one could ever come above
				She had me goin' crazy
				Oh, I was starstruck
				She woke me up daily
				Don't need no Starbucks
				She made my heart pound
				And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
				At school on the playground
				But I really wanna see her on the weekend
				She know she got me dazin'
				'Cause she was so amazin'
				And now my heart is breakin'
				But I just keep on sayin'
				Baby, baby, baby oh
				Like baby, baby, baby no
				Like baby, baby, baby oh
				I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
				Baby, baby, baby oh
				Like baby, baby, baby no
				Like baby, baby, baby ooh
				I thought you'd always be mine
				Now I'm gone
				Yeah, yeah, yeah
				Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
				Yeah, yeah, yeah
				Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
				Yeah, yeah, yeah
				Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
				Gone, gone, gone, I'm gone</pre>
